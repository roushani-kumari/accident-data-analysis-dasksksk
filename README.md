# Road Accident Data Analysis using Dask

This project performs scalable data analysis on a road traffic accident dataset using *Dask*, a parallel computing framework in Python. The dataset includes information about drivers, vehicles, road conditions, weather, casualties, and accident severity.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python 
- Dask (for big data analysis)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV Dataset (Accident Dataset.csv)

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following major columns:

- Sex_of_driver, Age_band_of_driver, Driving_experience
- Type_of_vehicle, Service_year_of_vehicle, Defect_of_vehicle
- Road_surface_type, Weather_conditions, Light_conditions
- Accident_severity, Number_of_casualties, Hour, Time_of_Day

## Insights from the Dataset

1. *Evening hours (5 PM to 8 PM)* recorded the most accidents.
2. *Male drivers* were involved in the majority of accidents.
3. *Drivers with less experience* (e.g., < 5 years) caused more accidents.
4. Most accidents occurred on *urban roads* with *dry surface*.
5. Weather conditions like *fog and rain* led to more severe accidents.
6. *Young age group (18â€“30)* had the highest involvement in crashes.
